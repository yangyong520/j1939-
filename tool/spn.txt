in an application.  If an application has only one accelerator control, use SPN 91.
For on-highway vehicles, this will typically be the operator’s accelerator pedal.  Although it is used as an input to 
determine powertrain demand, it also provides anticipatory information to transmission and ASR algorithms about driver 
actions.
In marine applications, this will typically be the operator’s throttle lever. 
If a low idle validation switch is used in conjunction with accelerator pedal position 1, use Accelerator Pedal Low Idle 
Switch 1, SPN 558.

SPN 518  Engine Requested Torque/Torque Limit 
Parameter provided to the engine or retarder in the torque/speed control message for controlling or limiting the output 
torque.
Requested torque to the engine is measured in indicated torque as a percentage of reference engine torque (see the 
engine configuration message, PGN 65251).  This is the engine torque at which the engine is expected to operate if the 
torque control mode is active or the engine torque which the engine is not expected to exceed if the torque limit mode is 
active. 
Zero torque can be requested which implies zero fuel and, according to Figures SPN512_A and SPN512_B, the engine 
will not be allowed to stall.  The actual engine percent torque (SPN 513) should be zero and the engine should decelerate 
until the low idle governor kicks in, at which time the actual engine percent torque will be calculated as shown in Figures 
SPN512_A and SPN512_B and the engine torque mode bits (SPN 899) should be equal to 0000b - Low Idle Governor. 
Requested torque to the retarder is measured in indicated torque as a percentage of reference retarder torque (see the 
retarder configuration message,  PGN 65249).  The logic used in enabling or disabling the retarder is based on the 
override control mode priority bits (SPN 897). 
A zero torque request to the retarder is a disable request, and is used by a J1939 node to prevent the retarder from being 
activated by other combinations of inputs outside of J1939 commands. The Torque Limit Mode is commonly used for this 
purpose.

SPN 519  Engine's Desired Operating Speed Asymmetry Adjustment 
This byte is utilized in transmission gear selection routines and indicates the engine's preference of lower versus higher 
engine speeds should its desired speed not be achievable.  This is a scaled ratio such that 125 represents an equal 
preference for a speed lower or higher that the engine's indicated desired speed.  The higher the asymmetry adjustment 
value is above 125, the more the engine prefers to be operated at or above its indicated desired speed.  Conversely, the 
lower the asymmetry adjustment value is below 125, the more the engine prefers to operate at or below its indicated 
desired speed.  Typically, the engine's asymmetry adjustment will be predicated on fuel consumption considerations, and 
under these conditions, the method for computing the asymmetry adjustment is indicated in Figure SPN519_A. The 
engine may include other factors into its asymmetry adjustment calculation such as temperatures, pressures, and other 
operating parameters.

0xE0 (224 dec) = Position unknown and/or no buttons pressed 
0xDF (223 dec) = Reverse Selector Position 
0xDE - 0xBE  (222 dec - 190 dec) = Reserved 
0x3C - 0x00   (60 dec  - 0 dec)  = Reserved 
Forward selector position from drive (0xF5 to 0xEF) – Indicates shift selector position in reference to the ‘Drive’ position 
on the selector.  It is possible that the shift selector software may not know the number of forward ranges.  The shift 
--``,```,,,,,,,,,``,`,`,,```,``,-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---SAE  J1939-71 - Revised MAY2012  - 65 -
selector may identify the position selected by the operator while the transmission ECU determines what range or gear that 
represents.  If there is a digital display, the transmission ECU would communicate what is to be displayed via another 
message such as ETC#2 or ETC#7. 
For example:  Consider a vehicle with a 5-speed automatic transmission with the shift lever on the column. Suppose that 
shift selector has a limited number of positions, such that having positions for D-4-3-2-1 is not an option. For this example, 
assume there are only have enough lever positions for D-3-2-1. Pulling the lever into "D" will put the transmission in 5th 
(highest gear).  It is desired that pulling the lever to the physical “3” position will limit the transmission to a maximum range
of 3rd gear. 
When the selector is pulled down into "3", the shifter selector itself has no way of correlating this physical lever position to
the desired gear; it would have to be calibrated with software to tell it this information. If not calibrated, the shift selector
cannot directly command the transmission to go to 3rd gear; it only knows it's one notch below drive. 
However, if "D-1" (lever position, as opposed to desired gear) is broadcast by the selector, the transmission ECU can 
receive this and then make the determination of what range is desired. The benefit is that no specific calibration of the 
shift selector is required.
Between selector positions (0xEE to 0xE2) – Indicates the shift selector is not in an appropriate position.  If a lever-type 
shift selector with a mechanical display is stuck between detents, it may appear to the operator that it is in the desired 
position when in fact it is not. The shift selector may be capable of reporting only that it is between positions or that it is
between forward or reverse positions. If known, the transmission ECU may respond differently depending on which 
positions are involved. 
Reselect current position (0xE1) - If the TC1 message continues to send the position last selected, then a capability to 
reselect the same position is required.  For example:  If a ‘Neutral to Drive’ shift is selected and that shift is inhibited (say
for high engine speed), it may be necessary for the operator to reselect ‘Drive’ after the inhibit conditions pass in order for
the transmission ECU to honor the request. 
Position unknown and/or no buttons pressed (0xE0) - A push-button style shift selector with momentary contact buttons 
may send this indicator after initialization before any buttons are pressed, or before the transmission ECU determines and 
communicates the initial selection.  This indicator could also be sent between button presses as an alternative to sending 
the last button press.

00 Override disabled - Disable any existing control commanded by the source of this command. 
01 Speed control - Govern speed to the included “desired speed” value. 
10 Torque control - Control torque to the included “desired torque” value. 
11 Speed/torque limit control - Limit speed and/or torque based on the included limit values.  The speed limit governor is 
a droop governor where the speed limit value defines the speed at the maximum torque available during this operation. 
If a device wants to know whether it has access to the engine, there are several possibilities: 
a. Comparing its command with the actual engine broadcasts. 
b. Looking at command modes from other devices. 
c. Looking to the engine and retarder torque mode. 
Remarks: 
a. The realization of a torque limit (minimum selection) is possible by setting the speed limit to a high value (0xFAFF). 
b. The realization of a speed limit (minimum selection) is possible by setting the torque limit to a high value (0xFA). 
c. Limiting the retarder torque means to limit the magnitude of the torque request.  As the brake torque is represented by 
negative torque values, the limitation must be done by a maximum selection of the requested torque and the retarder 
internal torque signals. 
d. For torque increasing functions, time limits for the torque or speed value (command) and the direct modes are 
desirable.
e. The selection of which device has control of the engine's speed or torque depends on the override mode priority (see 
SPN 897) with the highest priority device gaining control.  In the case of two devices with identical priority, the engine 
responds to speed/torque control commands over speed/torque limit commands and will act on the speed or torque 
commands on a first come, first served basis.  The torque limit will be a “lowest wins” selection (e.g., if one device 
commands 60% limit and another 80% limit, then the engine will limit torque to 60%).  Figure SPN695_A provides a 
flowchart of the torque/speed control priority selection logic.

SPN 696  Engine Requested Speed Control Conditions 
This mode tells the engine control system the governor characteristics that are desired during speed control.  The four 
characteristics defined are: 
00 Transient Optimized for driveline disengaged and non-lockup conditions 
01 Stability Optimized for driveline disengaged and non-lockup conditions 
10 Stability Optimized for driveline engaged and/or in lockup condition 1 (e.g., vehicle driveline) 
11 Stability Optimized for driveline engaged and/or in lockup condition 2 (e.g., PTO driveline) 
00b - This speed governor gain selection is adjusted to provide rapid transition between speed setpoints.  RPM overshoot 
and undershoot may be greater than what is seen when the “speed control characteristic” is set to be stability optimized. 
01b - This control condition has been optimized to minimize rpm overshoot and undershoot given an expected plant 
consisting of the engine and its accessory loads.  This gain adjustment is not intended to compensate for driveline 
characteristics.  This characteristic is most appropriate when no driveline is connected. 
10b - This control condition has been optimized to minimize rpm overshoot and undershoot given a more complex plant.
For instance, the more complex plant would contain the engine, its accessory loads and the driveline characteristics.  As 
--``,```,,,,,,,,,``,`,`,,```,``,-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---SAE  J1939-71 - Revised MAY2012  - 94 -
an example, the driveline characteristics might include the effective spring mass relationship of pumps, tires, clutches, 
axles, driveshafts, and multiple gear ratios.  This characteristic is most appropriate when a driveline is engaged. 
11b - This speed control characteristic is available for applications requiring compensation for more than one driveline 
characteristic.  It has been optimized to minimize rpm overshoot and undershoot given a more complex plant of the 
second variety.  This more complex plant would again contain the engine, its accessory loads and a second driveline 
characteristic unique from the one described in speed control characteristic 10b.

SPN 897  Override Control Mode Priority 
This field is used as an input to the engine or retarder to determine the priority of the Override Control Mode received in 
the Torque/Speed Control message (see PGN 0).  The default is 11 (Low priority).  It is not required to use the same 
priority during the entire override function.  For example, the transmission can use priority 01 (High priority) during a shift,
but can set the priority to 11 (Low priority) at the end of the shift to allow traction control to also interact with the torque
limit of the engine. 
The four priority levels defined are: 
00 Highest priority 
01 High priority 
10 Medium priority 
11 Low priority 
00b - Highest Priority = Used for situations that require immediate action by the receiving device in order to provide safe 
vehicle operation (i.e., braking systems).  This level of priority should only be used in safety critical conditions. 
01b -  High Priority  =  Used for control situations that require prompt action in order to provide safe vehicle operation.  An
example is when the transmission is performing a shift and requires control of the engine in order to control driveline 
reengagement.
10b - Medium Priority = Used for powertrain control operations which are related to assuring that the vehicle is in a stable 
operating condition.  An example is when the traction control system is commanding the engine in order to achieve 
traction stability. 
11b - Low Priority = Used to indicate that the associated command desires powertrain control but is needed for function 
which improves the driver comfort which may be overridden by other devices.  An example is cruise control or the non-
critical part of a transmission shift to a new gear.

SPN 899  Engine Torque Mode 
State signal which indicates which engine torque mode is currently generating, limiting, or controlling the torque.  Note 
that the modes are not in prioritized order. Not all modes may be relevant for a given device.  Some devices may not 
implement all functions.  For typical priorities refer to Figures SPN512_A and SPN512_B for engine control.  The data 
type of this parameter is measured.
Mode 0000b means “No request”: engine torque may range from 0 to full load only due to low idle governor output. 
Modes 0001b to 1110b indicate that there is either a torque request or the identified function is currently controlling the 
engine: engine torque may range from 0 (no fueling) to the upper limit.

of this parameter is measured.
Mode 0000b means “No request”: retarder torque = 0 (no braking). 
Modes 0001b to 1110b indicate that there is either a torque request or the identified function is currently controlling the

SPN 901  Retarder Type 
A vehicle retarder is a supplementary device to the wheel brakes for the driver to better control the vehicle.  The wheel 
brakes used in the vehicle are not designed for continuous retarding operation.  In a prolonged period of braking, the 
brakes can be thermally over-stressed, causing the braking effect to be reduced or even lead to complete braking system 
failure.  The vehicle retarder is designed for continuous operation for braking during downhill operation and is also used 
for braking the vehicle to comply with speed limits and traffic conditions. 
This parameter provides some indication of the retarder dynamics.  It is used in the retarder configuration message.  The 
data type of this parameter is measured.

respectively.  A variable speed fan will use 0% to 100%. Multiple fan systems will use 0 to 100% to indicate the percent 
cooling capacity being provided. 
Note that the intermediate fan speed of a three state fan will vary with different fan drives, therefore 50% is being used to 
indicate that the intermediate speed is required from the fan drive.

Total fuel consumed while neither the PTO or remote PTO governors are active, the engine speed is greater than zero, 
and vehicle speed is less than to 2 km/h, since the last trip reset. 
NOTE—This parameter is intended for gaseous fueled engines.  See SPN 1004 for alternate resolution.  Trip vehicle idle 
fuel while in fast idle (vehicle speed less than 2 km/h with engine speed greater than 700 rpm) shall be accumulated in 
the trip vehicle idle fuel category. All other fuel usage scenarios that do not fall directly in the categories defined shall be
accumulated in trip drive fuel used.

SPN 1011  Trip Cruise Fuel Used (Gaseous) 
Total fuel consumed while the engine is in the cruise hold state since the last trip reset.  If both cruise control and VSL 
(vehicle speed limiter) are commanding the same amount of fuel, the cruise control is deemed the active torque mode 
and fuel will be accumulated in "trip cruise fuel used" parameter.  If fuel commanded due to the accelerator pedal position 
is larger than fuel commanded by cruise control (e.g., accelerator override torque mode), the cruise control is not deemed 
the active torque mode and fuel will not be accumulated in the "trip cruise fuel used" parameter.

SPN 1573  LED Display Data #1 
Informs display devices how to display the current vertical position. 
Values which are less than 128 decimal are bit-mapped values and any combination of these values is considered a valid 
value.  For example communicating the "High Fine LED on" value to the display would result in the High Fine LED being 
turned on.  Communicating a value with the "High Fine LED on" bit set to "1" and the "On-Grade LED on" bit set to "1" 
should result in the display turning on the High Fine LED AND the On-Grade LED.
Values 128 decimal and above are discrete states.  Any bit-mapped combination of these states are invalid unless the 
results correspond to one of the states defined.  For example, the result of adding the "Low Coarse" and "Low Medium" 
states results in the "Low Medium" state, which is valid.  However, adding the "Low Medium" and the "Low Fine" states 
results in an value which does not have a defined state and is invalid.

SPN 1590  Adaptive Cruise Control Mode 
This parameter is used to indicate the current state, or mode, of operation by the Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) device. 
The states characterize independent system states (e.g., it is not possible to express distance control active and overtake 
mode simultaneously). ACC must not switch itself off while active because the driver expects it to work. So if an error 
occurs, the ACC must signal that to the driver so that the driver knows that he has to switch off the ACC. 
000 Off (Standby, enabled, ready for activation) 
001 Speed control active 
010 Distance control active 
011 Overtake mode 
100 Hold mode 
101 Finish mode 
110 Disabled or error condition 
111 Not available/not valid 
000b - Off—Used to indicate the ACC is enabled in calibration or configuration and there are no faults that would prevent 
the system from operating. 
001b - Speed Control Active—Used to indicate that ACC is on but not currently sending control messages.  In other 
words, there is no target ahead and regular vehicle cruise control is controlling the vehicle speed to the driver’s set speed. 
010b - Distance Control Active—Used to indicate that ACC is on and actively sending control messages to maintain the 
appropriate following interval. 
011b - Overtake Mode—Used to indicate that ACC is on but temporarily disabled because the driver is manually 
overriding cruise control by using either the accelerator pedal or the cruise control “accel” switch. 
100b - Hold Mode—Used to indicate that the ACC has lost the previous target vehicle and is in HOLD mode. In this 
mode, the ACC shall limit the speed to the speed held when the target was lost. For example,  if the driver activates the 
typical cruise buttons (Resume/Inc/Dec) the HOLD mode shall be exited and normal cruise functionality resumed. If a new 
target is detected, the Distance Control Active mode (010b) is again entered, unless existing conditions prohibit this. 
101b - Finish Mode—Used to indicate that ACC is on with no target ahead, and ACC is currently sending control 
messages to return to the driver’s set speed. This occurs when the target the ACC system was tracking moves out of the 
way so ACC returns the vehicle to the driver’s set speed. 
110b - Disabled or Error Condition—Used to indicate that ACC is in an error state and can not operate.

SPN 1717  Actual Maximum Available Retarder - Percent Torque 
This is the maximum amount of torque that the retarder can immediately deliver.  It is the same as the maximum torque 
shown in the Retarder’s Configuration message, but allows for a much faster rate of change than could be communicated 
by reissuing the configuration message.
Application Note: The purpose for this parameter is to allow a “Master” retarder controller to more accurately allocate the 
vehicle’s retarder requirements among multiple retarders. Its value should be the same as the value in the Configuration 
message at the time that message is assembled for broadcast, but may vary between those broadcasts.

(R) SPN 1734  Nominal Level Front Axle 
Signal which indicates the nominal (desired) height of the front axle to be controlled by the suspension system. 
These heights are discrete levels.  They are the upper level, lower level, normal level 1, normal level 2, normal level 3, 
customer level, and preset level.  Refer to Figure SPN1734_A. 
· Upper Level is the highest mechanically available height of the vehicle.
· Lower Level is the lowest mechanically available height of the vehicle.
Normal Levels 1, 2 and 3 are heights normally used during driving. 
· Normal Level 1 is most often used and is given by design.
· Normal Level 2 may be chosen, for example, to be lower than Normal Level 1 for the purpose of reducing fuel 
consumption while driving on highways.
· Normal Level 3 may be chosen above Normal Level 1 for driving off road. 
The preset level has to be set by means of ASC 6 (PGN: 53504). 
States 'Raising' and 'Lowering' are only active when corresponding states are requested in SPN 1751.  This provides the 
possibility to adjust vehicle to a level other than the predefined levels.

SPN 1845  Transmission Torque Limit 
Parameter provided to the engine from the transmission as a torque limit to be invoked by the engine in the event that 
J1939 communication with the transmission is lost. 
The intention is to protect transmissions that use a continuous torque limit during torque converter mode or operation in 
specific lower gears, where stall or drivetrain torque may reach levels higher than the gearbox capacity.  If communication 
is lost during torque limited operation, unrestricted engine torque output could harm the transmission. 
It is recommended that engines use reception of the ETC#1 message as a transmission “heartbeat”.  In the event that the 
ETC#1 message is not received in a time period of 5 times its’ broadcast rate (5 x 10 ms = 50 ms), the engine should 
invoke a torque limit holding the engine to less than or equal to the value of the Transmission Torque Limit parameter.
The engine may release the limit when transmission-to-engine communication is re-established. 
A value of 0xFF00 to 0xFFFF indicates that no transmission torque limit is desired. 
It is expected that the engine will record this torque value in non-volatile memory and will include this in the engine 
configuration PGN as parameter Engine Default Torque Limit (SPN 1846) 
If the engine observes change in this parameter value on power-up, the engine should record the new value.

SPN 1846  Engine Default Torque Limit 
Companion parameter to Transmission Torque Limit (SPN 1845). This “echo” parameter provides confirmation to the 
transmission that the engine has received and will invoke the requested Transmission Torque Limit in the event that 
J1939 communication is lost between the two devices. 
If the engine supports this protection logic, the Engine Default Torque Limit parameter should be set equal to the 
Transmission Torque Limit parameter as received in the Transmission Configuration 2 message (PGN 65099).
Otherwise, an Engine Default Torque Limit value of FF00 to FFFF indicates that no engine default torque limit has been 
received or set. 
The intention is to protect transmissions that use a continuous torque limit during torque converter mode or operation in 
specific lower gears, where stall or drivetrain torque may reach levels higher than the gearbox capacity.  If communication 
is lost during torque limited operation, unrestricted engine torque output could harm the transmission. 
It is recommended that engines use reception of the ETC#1 message as a transmission “heartbeat”.  In the event that the

display (if appropriate) will need to have its own balance function to compensate its nominal brightness to the same level 
of that of all other displays.  This is especially important for systems with back-lights which may change noticeable with 
aging.  In other words it will be necessary within a vehicle to scale all of the displays down to the same level as the

In some off-highway applications it may be desirable to have multiple droop settings available across the range of engine 
operation.  For example, in an agricultural tractor application, this functionality allows a higher engine speed during low 
load so as to maximize vehicle speed driven between fields on the road. Another use of the alternate droop settings

SPN 2900  Transmission Engine Crank Enable 
State signal from the transmission indicating if the transmission’s status is such that engine cranking is allowed (i.e.  at a 
minimum, transmission is in neutral and the driveline is disengaged).  As sender of this information, the transmission is 
responsible for correct indication immediately upon first broadcast of this parameter.
As with hard-wired neutral start implementations, those utilizing this parameter should consider the impact of the 
transmission or other controllers ‘resetting’ due to voltage drops during the engine start sequence. 
The vehicle system design should also consider the impact of timing latency in the engine starting sequence.  For 
example, the turn of an ignition key from ‘off’ to ‘start’ may happen more quickly than the transmission controller can boot 
up, determine its’ current state of being, and begin broadcasting information over the J1939 datalink.

If there are multiple devices on a network that provide this parameter, then users of this data shall add each of these 
values to determine the total torque loss due to engine parasitics.  Devices other than the engine that provide this 
parameter shall use the value of Engine Reference Torque transmitted by the engine during the current key cycle to 
determine the percent torque loss as seen by the engine. 
When the data value of this parameter is equal to FB it means that all parasitic losses calculated by the engine are 
included in the Engine's Nominal Friction Percent Torque (SPN 514).

a valid reading, the sender should broadcast one of those conditions until it is corrected; then the next condition can be

SPN 3156  Blade Control Mode Switch 
This parameter indicates the blade control mode switch state the user has set for the land leveling system.  The switch 
value directly correlates to the current switch state, regardless of the switch being used.  This parameter is intended for 
use in systems using only one parameter to control the blade movement (i.e. elevation).  Systems using two independent 
parameters to control blade position, i.e. one blade edge maintains a constant elevation and the other blade edge 
maintains a constant blade angle, should use parameters specific to that usage. Only one of the following states will be 
active at a time.   Below are the data values defined for each switch type that may be used in this application.  The 
purpose of the following switch information is to define what data should be reported based on what type of switch is 
used.
1.  A toggle button with two states can be used, in which the button is either in the manual or the auto position at all times.
 Toggle button usage is as follows: 
        Manual Position  = 0010 Manual button pressed 
        Auto Position       = 0011 Automatic button pressed 
2.   The momentary rocker switch may be used, where the default is the no button pressed position.  The user can press 
the rocker into the manual position, and when pressure is released, it will return to the no button pressed position.  The 
user may also press the rocker into the auto position, and when pressure is released, it will return to the no button 
pressed position.  Momentary rocker button usage is as follows: 
        No Button Pressed = 0000 No button pressed 
        Manual Button Pressed  = 0010 Manual button pressed 
        Auto Button Pressed  = 0011 Automatic button pressed 
3.    The momentary contact button pair may be used, where the default is no buttons being pressed.  The user can press 
the manual button, and when pressure is released, it will return to the no button pressed position.  The user may press 
the auto button, and when pressure is released, it will return to the no button pressed position.  Momentary contact 
buttons (button pair) usage is as follows: 
        No Button Pressed = 0000 No button pressed 
        Manual Button Pressed  = 0010 Manual button pressed 
        Auto Button Pressed  = 0011 Automatic button pressed 
4.    The momentary contact single button may be used, where the default is no button being pressed.  The user can 
press the button, which is the button pressed position, and when pressure is released, it will return to the no button 
pressed position.  The controller receiving this command will keep track of what mode the blade is in, auto or manual.
When the button is pressed, the "mode button pressed" state is reported and the receiving controller then changes the 
current mode to its opposite value (i.e. manual to automatic or vise-versa).  Momentary contact button (single button) 
usage is as follows: 
        No Button Pressed = 0000 No button pressed 
        Button Pressed  = 0001 Mode button pressed 
Data Values and Descriptions: 
0000 No button pressed 
0001 Mode button pressed 
0010 Manual button pressed 
0011 Automatic button pressed

Notes:
1.   The switch state can be read in two ways.  One method uses the direct analog switch input to determine the switch 
state, while the second method relies on a secondary control to read the analog input, then relay the information on the 
data link.  The parameter is designed to provide the actual switch state to other controls that need the information. 
2.   Other systems with automated blade controls should be able to use this parameter, since it is a measured switch 
value.SAE  J1939-71 - Revised MAY2012  - 394 -

SPN 3157  Desired Grade Offset Switch 
This parameter indicates the grade offset switch state the user has set for the land leveling system.  The desired grade 
offset value is the vertical offset measured from a given elevation reference point to the bottom edge of the blade.  This 
parameter is intended for use in systems using only elevation offset to control the blade movement (i.e. elevation).
Systems using two independent parameters to control blade position, i.e. one edge maintains a constant elevation and 
the other blade edge maintains a constant angle, should use parameters specific to that usage. Only one of the following 
states will be active at a time.   Below are the data values defined for each switch type that may be used in this 
application.  The purpose of the following switch information is to define what data should be reported based on what type 
of switch is used. 
1.  The momentary rocker switch may be used, where the default is the no button pressed position.  The user can press 
the rocker into the increment button pressed position, and when pressure is released, it will return to the no button 
pressed position.  The user may also press the rocker into the decrement button pressed position, and when pressure is 
released, it will return to the no button pressed position.  Momentary rocker button usage is as follows: 
     No Button Pressed = 0000 No button pressed 
     Increment Button Pressed  = 0001 Increment button pressed 
     Decrement Button Pressed  = 0010 Decrement button pressed 
2.  The momentary contact button pair may be used, where the default is the no buttons pressed position.  The user can 
press the increment button, and when pressure is released, it will return to the no buttons pressed position.  The user may 
press the decrement button, and when pressure is released, it will return to the no buttons pressed position.  Momentary 
contact button (button pair) usage is as follows: 
     No Button Pressed = 0000 No button pressed

SPN 3158  Blade Auto Mode Command 
Allows other controllers to command to the primary control system what they think is the appropriate auto control mode to 
be engaged in, based on the information they have available to them.  When in automatic mode, the blade automatically 
adjusts its position to the center of the blade to maintain a desired grade offset.  Only one of the following states will be 
active at a time.  Below is extended information describing each command.  The purpose of this information is to define 
what command state should be reported based on what auto control mode command is deemed appropriate by the 
operational specifications of the system. 
   0000 Auto Allowed - Auto mode permitted as appropriate (auto button was pushed or directly returned from Suspend 
Auto condition) 
   0001 Activity Allows Auto - Auto mode permitted only if the primary control system detects operator activity.  The control 
issuing this command does not have sufficient information/reason to absolutely allow Auto mode (state 0000) or not allow 
Auto mode (state 0100).  The control issuing this command is permitting the primary control system to operate in auto 
mode only if the primary control system detects operator activity, such as direct input to the primary control system.  If the 
primary control system does not detect operator activity, then the control issuing this command is not allowing auto mode. 
For example, the control issuing this command has detected no operator activity yet it acknowledges that there may be 
other sources of operator activity that might make auto mode permissible. 
   0010 Suspend Auto - Auto mode is temporarily not allowed and the control issuing this command wants the primary 
control system to automatically return to the previous state (Auto or Manual) when the suspend auto condition is 
removed.
   0011 Service Mode - Auto mode is permitted only for special services such as calibrations. 
   0100 Auto Not Allowed - Auto mode is not allowed under any condition 
Data Values and Descriptions: 
0000 Auto Allowed 
0001 Activity Allows Auto - must detect operator before auto allowed 
0010 Suspend Auto - temporarily suspend auto mode 
0011 Service Mode - auto allowed only during service modes 
0100 Auto Not Allowed 
1110 Error Indicator 
1111 Not Supported 
All other values are reserved 
Note:
The control issuing this command is aware that it does not have access to all information that the primary controller of the 
Land Leveling System attachment has access to.  Therefore, it commands the Land Leveling system to activate a auto 
blade mode based on the input it has access to.  In some cases, like in the "Activity Allows Auto" situation, the control 
knows the Land Leveling system has access to an additional display (which has switches and several buttons) which may 
help determine if an operator is present.  On the other hand, the control may also have information the primary controller 
of the Land Leveling System does not have access to, like the parking brake status.

The XBR message checksum is used to verify the signal path from the demanding device to the brake controller on 
electronic brake systems.  The support of this parameter is mandatory if PGN 1024 is supported as there is no means to 
indicate “not available”. 
The 4 bit XBR message checksum is calculated using the first 7 data bytes, the 4 bit message counter and the bytes of 
the message identifier.  It is calculated as follows: 
Checksum = (Byte1 + Byte2 + Byte3 + Byte4 + Byte5 + Byte6 + Byte7 + message counter&0x0F + message ID low byte + 
message ID mid low byte + message ID mid high byte + message ID high byte) 
XBR Message Checksum = ((Checksum >> 4) + Checksum) & 0x0F 
Note:  A failure in the communication sets the XBR system state: 
    - to '01' for failed XBR 'priority 01, 10 or 11' messages 
    - to '10' for failed XBR 'priority 00' messages.

SPN 3256  Aftertreatment 2 Intake O2 
The actual oxidation factor (%O2) of the gas within the exhaust stream.  For positive values, the parameter represents the 
percent oxygen in excess of the amount required for stoichiometric combustion.  For negative values, the parameter is 
proportional to the amount of oxygen being pumped by the sensor.  This value is measured by a sensor at the 
aftertreatment intake in exhaust bank 2.  (For a single exhaust bank system, refer to parameters in PGNs 61454, 61455,
64946, 64947, 64948, and 65247) 
A value of -12% (0x0000) indicates rich, a value of 21% (0xFAFF) indicates lean.  These data points could optionally be 
used with switching O2 sensors to indicate those states as alternatives to broadcasting the threshold %O2 values. 
Diagnostic Tools could change display to use the text "Rich" or "Lean" in place of the implied %O2 values which would 
also be acceptable for display.

Feedback of the SPN 525 Transmission Requested Gear input as received from the shift selector, ABS or engine via 
PGN 256, Transmission Control 1 (TC1) or other transmission selector input.  Scaling, values and parameter specific 
indicators are identical to those listed for SPN 525 Requested Gear. 
This feedback from the transmission allows shift selectors and other TC1 input devices to verify that their Transmission 
Requested Gear command has been properly received by the transmission.  (This parameter is not intended for driver 
display purposes). 
In systems with mechanical or electrical shift selectors which do not support J1939 communication, this parameter allows 
the transmission ECU to convey the requested gear as interpreted by the transmission from its mechanical or electrical 
input.

SPN 3334  Left Blade Control Mode Operator Control 
This parameter indicates the left blade control mode operator control state the user has set for the land leveling system.
The operator control value directly relates to the current operator control state correlating to the left edge of the blade.
The purpose of this parameter is to set the control mode (auto/manual) for the left side of the blade. For this system, the 
left and right side of the blade can be adjusted independently of each other to either change the elevation from a given 
reference point or the blade angle (also known as blade tilt)/cross slope depending on the function requested by the 
operator.
This parameter is intended for use in systems using two parameters (right/left) to control the blade as described above.
Systems using only one parameter to control blade position, i.e. elevation, should use the Blade Control Mode Switch 
parameter. Only one of the following states will be active at a time.   In the example below, data values are defined for 
each switch type that may be used in an application.  The purpose of the following switch information is to define what 
data should be reported based on what type of switch is used. 
1.  A toggle button with two states can be used, in which the button is either in the manual or the auto position at all times.
Toggle button usage is as follows: 
     Manual Button Pressed = 0010    Manual Operator Control Request 
     Automatic Button Pressed  = 0011    Automatic Operator Control Request 
     Invalid Switch Input(ex. auto and manual read/pressed simultaneously)  = 1110    Error Indicator 
2. The momentary rocker switch may be used, where the default is the no button pressed position.  The user can press 
the rocker into the manual position, and when pressure is released, it will return to the no button pressed position.  The 
user may also press the rocker into the auto position, and when pressure is released, it will return to the no button 
pressed position. 
Momentary rocker button usage is as follows: 
     No button pressed                = 0000    No change 
     Manual Button Pressed = 0010    Manual Operator Control Request 
     Automatic Button Pressed  = 0011    Automatic Operator Control Request 
     Invalid Switch Input(ex. auto and manual read/pressed simultaneously)  = 1110    Error Indicator 
3.  The momentary contact button pair may be used, where the default is no buttons being pressed.  The user can press 
the manual button, and when pressure is released, it will return to the no button pressed position.  The user may press 
the auto button, and when pressure is released, it will return to the no button pressed position. 
Momentary contact buttons (button pair) usage is as follows: 
     No button pressed                = 0000    No change

     Automatic Button Pressed  = 0011    Automatic Operator Control Request 
     Invalid Switch Input(ex. auto and manual read/pressed simultaneously)  = 1110    Error Indicator 
4.  The momentary contact single button may be used, where the default is no button being pressed.  The user can press 
the button, which is the button pressed position, and when pressure is released, it will return to the no button pressed 
position.  The controller receiving this command will keep track of what mode the blade is in, auto or manual.  If the blade 
is in manual mode to begin with, one press of the button will change to mode to auto.  If the button is pressed again, the 
blade will be put into manual mode. 
Momentary contact button (single button) usage is as follows: 
    No button pressed                = 0000    No change 
    Mode Button Pressed = 0001    Momentary Operator Control Request

SPN 3336  Left Desired Blade Offset Operator Control 
This parameter indicates the left blade offset operator control state the user has set for the land leveling system.  The left 
desired blade offset value is the offset measured from a given reference point to the bottom left edge of the blade. This 
parameter will only be used when the control mode for land leveling system has been set to auto. The purpose of this 
parameter is to adjust the elevation from a given reference point or the blade angle(also known as blade tilt)/cross slope 
depending on the function being requested by the operator for the left side of the blade. 
This parameter is intended for use in systems using two parameters(left/right) to control the blade as described above.
Systems using only one parameter to control blade position, i.e. elevation, should use the Desired Blade Offset Switch 
parameter. Only one of the following states will be active at a time. 
In the example below, data values are defined for each switch type that may be used in an application.  The purpose of

SPN 3337  Right Desired Blade Offset Operator Control 
This parameter indicates the right blade offset operator control state the user has set for the land leveling system.  The 
right desired blade offset value is the offset measured from a given reference point to the bottom right edge of the blade. 
This parameter will only be used when the control mode for land leveling system has been set to auto. The purpose of 
this parameter is to adjust the elevation from a given reference point or the blade angle(also known as blade tilt)/cross 
slope depending on the function being requested by the operator for the left side of the blade. 
This parameter is intended for use in systems using two parameters(left/right) to control the blade as described above.
Systems using only one parameter to control blade position, i.e. elevation, should use the Desired Blade Offset Switch 
parameter. Only one of the following states will be active at a time. 
In the example below, data values are defined for each switch type that may be used in an application.  The purpose of 
the following switch information is to define what data should be reported based on what type of switch is used. 
1. The momentary rocker switch may be used, where the default is the neutral position with no buttons pressed.  The user 
can press the rocker into the increment button pressed position, and when pressure is released, it will return to the neutral 
position.  The user may also press the rocker into the decrement button pressed position, and when pressure is released, 
it will return to the neutral position. Momentary rocker button usage is as follows: 
     Neutral position = 0000  No Operator Control Request 
     Increment Button Pressed  = 0001   Increment Operator Control Request 
     Decrement Button Pressed  = 0010   Decrement Operator Control Request 
     Invalid Switch Input(ex. inc./dec. values read simultaneously)  = 1110    Error Indicator 
2. The momentary contact button pair may be used, where the default is the neutral position with no buttons pressed.
The user can press the increment button, and when pressure is released, it will return to the neutral position.  The user 
may press the decrement button, and when pressure is released, it will return to the neutral position.  Momentary contact 
button (button pair) usage is as follows: 
      No Button Pressed = 0000 No Operator Control Request 
      Increment Button Pressed = 0001 Increment Operator Control Request 
      Decrement Button Pressed = 0010 Decrement Operator Control Request 
      Invalid Switch Input(ex. inc./dec. values read simultaneously)  = 1110 Error Indicator

Notes:   
1.  The operator control state can be read in two ways.  One method uses the direct operator control input to determine 
the operator control state, while the second method relies on a secondary control to read the operator control input, then SAE  J1939-71 - Revised MAY2012  - 438 -
relay the information on the data link.  The parameter is designed to provide the actual operator control state to other 
controls that need the information. 
2.  Other systems with automated blade controls should be able to use this parameter, since it is an actual operator 
control value.

SPN 3338  Side-shift Blade Control Mode Operator Control 
This parameter indicates the side-shift offset operator control state the user has set for the land leveling system. When an 
implement moves in a side-shift direction, it moves from side to side, usually along its longitudinal axis. The desired side-
shift offset value is the offset measured from a given vertical reference point to the center of the blade. 
Only one of the following states will be active at a time. In the example below, the data values are defined for each switch 
type that may be used in an application. The purpose of the following switch information is to define what data should be 
reported based on what type of switch is used. 
1. The momentary rocker switch may be used, where the default is the neutral position with no buttons pressed. The user 
can press the rocker into the increment button pressed position, and when pressure is released, it will return to the neutral

SPN 3339  Side-shift Desired Blade Offset Operator Control 
This parameter indicates the side-shift blade control mode operator control state the user has set for the land leveling 
system.  When an implement moves in a side-shift direction, it moves from side to side, usually along its longitudinal axis. 
The operator control value directly correlates to the current operator control state.  Only one of the following states will be
active at a time.  In the example below, the data values are defined for each switch type that may be used in an 
application.  The purpose of the following switch information is to define what data should be reported based on what type 
of switch is used. 
1.  A toggle button with two states can be used, in which the button is either in the manual or the auto position at all times.
 Toggle button usage is as follows: 
     Manual Position  = 0010 Manual Operator Control Request 
     Auto Position  = 0011 Automatic Operator Control Request 
2.  The momentary rocker switch may be used, where the default is the no button pressed position.  The user can press 
the rocker into the manual position, and when pressure is released, it will return to the no button pressed position.  The 
user may also press the rocker into the auto position, and when pressure is released, it will return to the no button 
pressed position.  Momentary rocker button usage is as follows: 
     No Button Pressed = 0000 No Operator Control Request 
     Manual Button Pressed  = 0010 Manual Operator Control Request 
     Auto Button Pressed  = 0011 Automatic Operator Control Request 
3.  The momentary contact button pair may be used, where the default is no buttons being pressed.  The user can press 
the manual button, and when pressure is released, it will return to the no button pressed position.  The user may press 
the auto button, and when pressure is released, it will return to the no button pressed position.  Momentary contact 
buttons (button pair) usage is as follows: 
     No Button Pressed = 0000 No Operator Control Request 
     Manual Button Pressed  = 0010 Manual Operator Control Request 
     Auto Button Pressed  = 0011 Automatic Operator Control Request 
4.  The momentary contact single button may be used, where the default is no button being pressed.  The user can press 
the button, which is the button pressed position, and when pressure is released, it will return to the no button pressed 
position.  The controller receiving this command will keep track of what mode the blade is in, auto or manual.  If the blade 
is in manual mode to begin with, one press of the button will change to mode to auto.  If the button is pressed again, the 
blade will be put into manual mode.  Momentary contact button (single button) usage is as follows: 
     No Button Pressed = 0000 No Operator Control Request 
     Button Pressed  = 0001 Momentary Operator Control Request

SPN 3357  Actual Maximum Available Engine - Percent Torque 
This is the maximum amount of torque that the engine can immediately deliver as a percentage of the reference engine 
torque (SPN 544).  The Actual Maximum Available Engine - Percent Torque shall take into consideration all engine torque 
derates (e.g. air fuel ratio control (AFC), noise control, etc.) that could potentially be active in the system.  This parameter
differentiates itself from the engine percent torque points 1 through 5 of the engine configuration map because it takes 
into account all dynamic internal inputs such as  AFC and that it is updated on a 50ms basis.

This parameter indicates what kind of light distribution is set by the AFS system for the right headlamp. 
0000   Light distribution town - The basic light distribution for town light is generated with a symmetrical cut-off line (Class
V)
0001   Light distribution country - Country light is mostly similar to the actual SAE low beam pattern. (Class C) 
0010   Light distribution motorway - The task of motorway light is an improved overall viewing distance and an optimum of 
illumination of the second lane on roads with more than one lane and without oncoming traffic. (Class E) 
0011   Light distribution high beam - The high beam distribution of the module generates an illumination level that an 
additional high beam spot is not necessary. 
0100   Light distribution adverse weather - The adverse weather light improves the viewing situation for the driver on wet 
roads and reduces the amount of glare from reflections on wed reads for the oncoming traffic. (Class W)
0101   Light distribution fail safe position - Module is damaged, current light distribution does not affect oncoming traffic. 
0110   Light distribution failure - Module is damaged, current position may affect oncoming traffic. 
0111   Different light distributions not available -  No AFS distributions available. Head lamp has only one distribution.

SPN 4099  XBR urgency 
The idea of the urgency value is to adjust the endurance brake integration behavior in the EBS system according to the 
traffic situation. 
On low urgency values (0%, e.g. downhill cruise control or preceding vehicle far ahead) the brake system shall primarily 
use endurance brakes to reduce lining wear. 
On high urgency values (100%, e.g. vehicle close up or a vehicle cuts into the traffic line just before host vehicle) the 
brake system is expected to gain the demanded deceleration (acceleration) as fast as possible. 
Values:
0% - Situation not critical; low retarder dynamics are tolerated. Activation of the foundation brakes after a time if retarder 
performance is insufficient 
y % - Faster activation of foundation brakes to compensate retarder performance, linear interpolation between 0 and
100%
100% - Low retarder dynamics shall be fully compensated by the foundation brakes 
Notes:
- This parameter has only an effect if XBR EBI switch is set to "10: endurance brake integration allowed" 
- XBR urgency makes sense only if the XBR request(s) is (are) processed in one device like the EBS controller which also 
sends TSC1 to the retarder(s). Such a data flow diagram is shown in figure PGN1024_A. When the Retarder is controlled 
directly by the XBR transmitter XBR urgency should be set to not available. 
In adaptive cruise control (ACC) operation there are situations where it is useful to have as less lining wear as possible 
like keeping the set speed on going downhill. It would not be useful to activate foundation brakes in such a situation 
except when the capabilities of the endurance brakes are not sufficient. 
In other situations like emergency braking or fast reaction on a car that cut in at a short distance in front of the own 
vehicle a reaction as fast as possible is needed. In such cases low retarder dynamics must be compensated by the 
foundation brakes. 
There are two different ways to integrate the endurance brakes into the adaptive cruise control. 
a) the request for deceleration could be processed by the EBS system completely. This means that the EBS receives the 
deceleration demand and activates the friction and/or the endurance brakes accordingly. EBS is sending the TSC1 to the 
retarder. (see figure PGN1024_A dataflow diagram for external brake request) 
b) the ACC sends XBR to the brake controller and TSC1 to the endurance brakes. 
In case "a)" the ACC system does not have direct control of the endurance brakes. To adjust the endurance brakes 
according to the traffic situation (high or low urgency values see above) this new SPN is needed. 
If the retarder performance is not sufficient (e.g. because of high retarder temperature) the foundation brakes will be 
added automatically. This case of not sufficient retarder performance cannot be covered by switching EBI mode from 01 SAE  J1939-71 - Revised MAY2012  - 591 -
(endurance brakes only) to EBI mode 10 (endurance brake integration allowed) because the actual deceleration caused 
by the retarder is less than the requested decelleration. A simple switching (01 to 10) would cause an uncomfortable jerk.

This parameter displays an additional torque in percent of the reference engine torque.
When the MSB is set to 1, this parameter is not available.  When the MSB is set to 0, bits 1 to 3 indicate the desired 
torque with resolution of 0.125%/bit . Range is from 0 to 0.875% of reference torque.
The parameter is used in combination with SPN 513 Actual Engine Torque. The resulting actual engine torque will be 
calculated by adding these two parameters.

For example, if SPN 513 = 150 (or 25%) and this parameter is 0100, the torque would be 25.5%. 
If SPN 513 = 175 (or 50%) and this parameter is 0001, the torque would be 50.125% 
If SPN 513 = 175 (or 50%) and this parameter is 1111, the torque would remain 50% (no high resolution available)

SPN 4191  Engine Requested Torque -  High Resolution 
This parameter displays an additional torque in percent of the reference engine torque.
When the MSB is set to 1, this parameter is not available.  When the MSB is set to 0, bits 1 to 3 indicate the desired 
torque with resolution of 0.125%/bit . Range is from 0 to 0.875% of reference torque.
The parameter is used in combination with SPN 518  Engine Requested Torque/Torque Limit. The resulting torque/torque 
limit will be calculated by adding these two parameters.
Validity of Engine Requested Torque High Res has no effect on SPN 518.

SPN 4242  Transmission Reverse Gear Shift Inhibit Request 
Allows devices external to the normal transmission shift selector system to request the transmission to inhibit shifts into 
any Reverse gear and force the transmission into Neutral if it is currently in Reverse or attempting to shift to Reverse.
These transmission responses occur regardless of shift selector (Forward, Neutral or Reverse) position at the time the 
request is received. 
This request would typically come from a component wishing to override the vehicle operator’s ability to shift or keep the 
transmission in Reverse.  For example, the control system of a rear-loading refuse packer may wish to prevent shifts to 
reverse when it detects the presence of someone behind the vehicle. 
Reverse gear shift inhibits include all ‘Neutral-to-Reverse’ shifts and ‘Forward-to-Reverse’ shifts; the ability of the 
transmission to complete ‘Neutral-to-Forward’ or ‘Forward-to-Forward’ gear shifts is not impacted. 
If the transmission is in Reverse or attempting to shift to Reverse and receives an active Reverse gear shift inhibit request 
(0b01), the transmission will shift to Neutral.  When the request subsequently goes inactive (0b00), the transmission will 
remain in Neutral until it receives a selector input from the vehicle operator requesting it to shift into a Non-Neutral gear. 
The transmission should not automatically return to the previous gear when this signal goes inactive. 
Transmission response to this request can be monitored via SPN 4261 – Transmission Reverse Gear Shift Inhibit Status, 
SPN 523 Transmission Current Gear, and SPN 524 Transmission Selected Gear.

SPN 4255  Transmission Requested Launch Gear 
Initial gear for the transmission to start out in when the vehicle is launched from a standing stop, as specified by the 
vehicle operator or vehicle system.  Automatic transmissions typically default to starting out in 1st gear.  However, in 
applications such as those with very low gearing, it is desirable to launch the vehicle in a range higher than 1st.   For 
example, when the vehicle has little or no payload, the operator may wish to launch from 2nd or 3rd gear to avoid 
stacked, unnecessary shifts in the lower ranges. 
0000 = No specific launch gear requested; use default launch gear 
0001 = Launch the vehicle in 1st gear 
0010 = Launch the vehicle in 2nd gear 
0011 = Launch the vehicle in 3rd gear

percentage, etc.).  If there are multiple inputs to this parameter that may cause active DPF regeneration, the highest value 
shall always be reported. 
100% is the level at which active diesel particulate filter regeneration should be triggered. 100% level is the active 
regeneration trigger level (and if conditions are not favorable for regeneration, soot loading can continue beyond 100%). 
During normal operation and regeneration a value 0% will indicate a fully regenerated diesel particulate filter. Values of

SPN 5603  Cruise Control Disable Command 
This parameter is used to disable cruise control from a source other than the driver controlled switch if cruise control is 
active.  It is also used to inhibit cruise control from becoming active if it is not currently active.  If this parameter is used to 
disable cruise control, then cruise control will need to be re-initialized and the previous set speed will not be retained.
This parameter has priority over Cruise Control Resume Command (SPN 5604).  See Figure PGN2560_A for an 
explanation of how this relates to other parameters. 
Use of this parameter is in addition to Cruise Control Enable Switch (SPN 596). The Cruise Control Enable Switch set to

SPN 5604  Cruise Control Resume Command 
This parameter is used to request the cruise control to resume operation from a source other than the driver controlled

Possible restrictions include only honoring this request if it is received within a certain time period after cruise control has
been disabled, a vehicle speed differential has been exceeded since cruise control has been cancelled, etc.
This request will only be honored if it is received from the same device as the one that sent the Cruise Control Pause 
Command (SPN 5605). 
Cruise Control Disable Command (SPN 5603) and Cruise Control Pause Command (SPN 5605) both have a higher 
priority than this parameter.  See Figure PGN2560_A for an explanation of how this relates to other parameters.

SPN 5605  Cruise Control Pause Command 
This parameter is used to temporarily disable cruise control from a source other than the driver controlled switch if cruise 
control is active.  If this parameter is used to disable cruise control, then cruise control will not need to be re-initialized and 
the previous set speed will be retained.  In order for the cruise control system to resume to the previous set speed, a valid 
command must be received.  Valid commands include (1) the Cruise Control Resume Switch (SPN 601), (2) the Cruise 
Control Set Switch (SPN 599), or (3) Cruise Control Resume Command (SPN 5604). 
This parameter has priority over Cruise Control Resume Command (SPN 5604).  See Figure PGN2560_A for an 
explanation of how this relates to other parameters.
This parameter is not the physical switch that is used to pause cruise control.  See SPN 1633 for the physical switch. 
Receiving this parameter to disable cruise control has the same effect on cruise control as tapping the brake pedal.

this parameter will be the source address of the device that first began sending 01 for the command.  If the device that 
first sent 01 for Cruise Control Pause Command is no longer sending 01 for the command, then the value of the Source 
Address of Controlling Device for Pausing Cruise Control shall be set to the source address of a device that is still 
sending the Cruise Control Disable Command with a value of 01. 
This parameter is supported by the device that has the capability to receive and process the Cruise Control Pause 
Command (SPN 5605). 
254 (0xFE) is used to indicate that the Source Address of Controlling Device for Pausing Cruise Control parameter is 
supported, but no device is currently inhibiting cruise control with the Cruise Control Pause Command (SPN 5605).

SPN 5624  Trailer-VDC Active 
The trailer-VDC (Vehicle Dynamic Control) is an electronic vehicle stability function within the (semi) trailer braking 
system. It acts to stabilize the (semi) trailer during dynamic maneuvers. VDC includes Roll Over Prevention (ROP) and/or 
Yaw Control (YC), However, the latter information is not individually available and the VDC active parameter will be set in 
both cases. 
This parameter maps the 6.4.2.2.36 VDC active parameter of the ISO 11992_2 bus (trailer-bus) to the SAE J1939 
(vehicle bus). This makes it possible to warn the driver if one of the trailers activate the brakes because of  an VDC 
function active in the trailer.

According to the Vienna world convention on road traffic the driver must be provided with means to deactivate an 
Advanced Emergency Braking System. This command is to be transmitted from the respective HMI unit to the AEBS unit. 
00 - the driver does not want the Advanced Emergency Braking System to warn or intervene at any time (deactivation of 
system) 
01 - the driver wants the Advanced Emergency Braking System to warn or intervene if necessary (no deactivation of 
system) 
10 - reserved 
11 - don’t' care / take no action 
Note:  The signal has to be transmitted permanently to the AEBS showing the state selected once by the driver.  Typically 
there is a deactivation push button present in the host vehicle for the driver to choose this state. 
Example: After ignition-on the signal is being transmitted as 01b (this will be the default state in Europe) all the time. As 
soon as the driver depresses the push button the signal's value has to change to 00b for the remaining ignition cycle as 
long as the driver does not depress the push button again.

(R) SPN 5793  Desired Engine Fueling State 
Devices send this request to the engine controller to: 
(a) Shut off engine fueling, but remain prepared to re-start quickly by not shutting down the control system, or 
(b) Keep the engine running. 
00 Fueling not desired (shut off engine fueling) 
01 Fueling desired (keep engine running) 
10 Parameter supported, but no request 
11 Don't care / Take no action 
If the engine controller receives this parameter from multiple sources, then '01-Fueling desired' shall have priority over 
'00-Fueling not desired'. 
If this request can be honored by the receiving device as indicated by SPN 5795, then it shall be processed independently 
of other means to stop engine fueling (i.e., SPN 970 Engine Auxiliary Shutdown Switch or the Keyswitch). For example, if 
the engine is acting on SPN 5793 set to 01 (keep engine running) and the vehicle keyswitch is turned off, then the engine 
shall shut off. 
Use examples of this parameter include, but are not limited to: 
1. In applications or situations where the engine can be physically disconnected from the hybrid powertrain, a command 
of 00 could be used to request the engine to stop running, and as a result, stop rotating. 
2. In applications or situations where engine-driven accessories (power steering, etc.) must remain active while the 
engine is not running, a command of 00 could result in the engine no longer running even as it continues to be spun 
(motored) by the hybrid powertrain. 
3. In applications or situations where components want to keep the engine running, such as an aftertreatment system, a 
command of 01 could be used to prevent the engine from honoring requests from other devices using this parameter to 
shut off fueling.

This parameter is broadcast by the engine control system, and indicates to other devices on the network whether or not it 
will respond to requests to inhibit engine fueling via SPN 5793 Desired Engine Fueling State. With this information, 
devices that may wish to inhibit engine fueling at some time in the future can know whether or not their request will be

XIII, Section 4 for usage requirements. 
000 - Off - Used when driver warning system is non-active - which, by requirement, means the low-level and severe 
inducement systems are also non-active 
001 - On – solid - Used when driver warning system is activated for any relevant malfunction 
010 - reserved for SAE assignment 
011 - reserved for SAE assignment

Note: SPN 5825 is similar to SPN 5245.  SPN 5825 is intended to be used in implementations where the warning 
indicator is used to convey diesel exhaust fluid tank low level and specific emission control malfunction information, 
whereas SPN 5245 is intended to be used in implementations where the warning indicator is used to convey diesel

EXAMPLE: If a Bi-fuel vehicle has less than 10% ethanol in the gasoline/petrol, then the external test equipment shall 
display state 0x09. In such a case, the system would be using gasoline/petrol (fuel) tables and OBD thresholds. SPN 
5458 should either artificially display 0% or some number 10% or less if the system has such resolution. If the ethanol in 
the gasoline/petrol is above 10%, then the external test equipment shall display state 0x0B. SPN 5458 shall report the 
calculated ethanol/alcohol percentage.

Only one condition can be conveyed in this parameter at any given point in time. If multiple conditions exist, it is not 
important which condition is actually broadcast, as the driver must ‘correct’ each and every condition as it is presented 
before a valid oil level reading can be made. If multiple conditions exist that prevent a valid reading, the sender should 
broadcast one of those conditions until it is corrected; then the next condition can be conveyed to the operator, and so on.

PGN 0  Torque/Speed Control 1  TSC1 
NOTE - Retarder may be disabled by commanding a torque limit of 0%.  Use of the limit mode allows the use of the 
retarder only up to the limit specified in the request.  This can be used to permit retarding of up to 50%, for example, if that
limit is required by some device such as an EBS, or it can disable the use of the retarder by others, as when an ABS 
controller detects wheel slip. 
Note that the 10 ms transmission repetition rate is intended for temporary powertrain control (P32 of SPN 3350).  Slower 
transmission rates (for control purposes P1 through P31 of SPN 3350) may be supported for longer duration control.
